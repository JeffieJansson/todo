# Todo App – Global State Management with Zustand

This project is a Todo application built with React and Zustand.  
The purpose of the project is to demonstrate an understanding of **global state management**, clean code structure, accessibility, and responsive design without using prop drilling.


## 🎯 Project Goals

- Understand and apply global state management
- Use Zustand instead of React Context or prop drilling
- Build a clean, accessible, and responsive user interface
- Structure the project in a clear and maintainable way

## ✅ Project Requirements

The application fulfills the following requirements:

- Global state is managed using **Zustand**. No prop drilling
- The app can:
  - List all tasks - completed and uncompleted
  - Add tasks and delete tasks
  - Be able to mark an uncompleted task as complete (and change it back to uncompleted)
  - A task counter is displayed (all tasks or uncompleted tasks)
- A friendly **empty state** is shown when there are no tasks
- The app is responsive from **320px up to 1600px**
- Accessibility guidelines are followed:
  - You should have a score of at least 95 in Lighthouse
  - All images should have alt attributes and proper sizes
  - All contrasts should be OK
  - The app aims for a **Lighthouse score of at least 95**
- Clean code principles are followed throughout the project
